  I truly loved everything I learned at Flatiron. This past (almost) year has been a truly lifechanging experience and I feel like I've gained so much meaningful knowledge,
both through Flatiron and outside of it. Thank you to Chett and the rest of the people who were there to help guide me along the way. I definitely would not have been
where I am now were it not for him.
  That being said, I'm happy it's over. All good things must come to an end and it was definitely time to graduate. Thank you Flatiron for taking me through this 
  journey. Here's hoping the world goes back to normal.
